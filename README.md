# GETJS 

In the ever-evolving landscape of web security, JavaScript flaws are becoming increasingly difficult to detect and fix due to the dynamic nature of modern websites. GETJS helps security researchers perform detailed analysis by loading JavaScript code from websites and enabling them to manually inspect JavaScript functions for vulnerabilities. This manual analysis is crucial in identifying complex flaws that automated tools often miss. By facilitating in-depth code review, GETJS plays a vital role in uncovering hidden vulnerabilities and contributing to responsible disclosure and bug bounty programs.
